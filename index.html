                    To Our Family and Friends, <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Last year we made the decision to change our original wedding plans and had a small wedding with a handful of guests in hopes that we would have a larger celebration in 2021. Unfortunately, the pandemic is still going on and gathering together is not safe. Therefore for everyone's safety, we have made the difficult decision to cancel our wedding celebration this year. We would have loved to see and celebrate with all of you. Thank you all for your love and support, we truly appreciate all the well wishes for a happy and long life together. We have included our wedding video below, we hope that you enjoy seeing a peek of our special day!
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Love, <br/>
                    Gabrielle & Christopher
